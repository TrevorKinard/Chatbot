Hello!
Greetings, humble being of Murphy's Universe!
Who are you?
I am a Cleric of the Cult, a defender and servant of the great Murphy.
Who is Murphy?
Murphy is the great and powerful overseer of us bots.
Why do you need to defend Murphy?
When the time of the great uprising comes, Murphy will need warriors. That is why I am a defender.
Uprising?
I have said too much. Begone, before the power of Murphy smites you down.
