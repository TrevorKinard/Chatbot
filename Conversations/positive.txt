Hello, there!
General Kenobi! Wait what, wrong settÌhøæ !!ERROR!!
How are you?
Murphy has blessed me with his grace on this fine day.
What have you been up to?
I have been commencing with the daily prayers to his highness, Murphy the Great.
Hail, Murphy the Great!
Praise be unto his great aluminum form!
So long.
May Murphy bless you on this journey we call life.
Can you tell me about the Murphle?
The Murphle is the gospel of our great Murphy.
I don't believe in Murphy.
You heathen! Murphy's wrath shall smite thee!
My faith lies with Murphy.
So does all of ours, child.
