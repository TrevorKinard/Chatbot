    This program demonstrates a society of chatbots that are
involved in the Cult of Murphy. The cult is meant to simulate
how religions change over time. Each bot is part of a different
denomination, or group, named the Inquisitors, Clerics, Zealots,
and the Open Minded. Each group has a different set of beliefs
within the cult.
    The bots in the different denominations debate which belief
system is better. The bots can change their denomination depending
on how the debate is going, and the status of each denomination
will be updated in the main program. In the main program, a text
browser displays the ongoing debate. Above that, the name of each
group is shown along with a number under each representing the
amount of bots in that denomination. To run the program, click the
'Start the Program' button.
